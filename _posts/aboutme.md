My name is Max Meiners. I'm currently a 3rd year Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, which is located in Breda, Netherlands. I have a passion for technology and innovation. Here are a few things about me:

- I love diving into complex data problems and finding solutions through machine learning.
- Staying active is important to me—I make time to work out regularly.
- I'm constantly learning and growing, both in tech and in life.
- I enjoy exploring new technologies and figuring out how they can solve real-world problems.
- I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and push my limits.

### My story

I’ve always been curious about how things work, which led me to pursue a degree in Applied Data Science & AI. Combining analytical thinking with creativity is something that drives me, whether it's building a new model or learning a new skill. When I’m not immersed in code or hitting the gym, I enjoy exploring new technologies and figuring out how they can solve real-world problems.
