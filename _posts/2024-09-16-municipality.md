  <p>For this project, my team and I worked on a project for the municipality of Breda. The goal was to apply the full CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) cycle in a real-world setting. After completing individual tasks such as legal reviews and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and SQL, we presented project proposals based on our findings. Our team selected the best idea and started collaborating to build a data science product for deployment.

  <p>
    The primary focus of this block was on the <strong>Deployment</strong> phase of the CRISP-DM lifecycle, where we had the opportunity to turn our project idea into a tangible solution for the municipality. We explored different ways to tackle their data-related problems and developed a web-based application using Streamlit, which allowed us to visualize and interact with the data in real time. This project combined technical and project management skills, requiring us to handle everything from client communication to final deployment.

  <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The municipality of Breda had multiple data sources but lacked a unified way to extract meaningful insights.</li>
    <li>Our analysis revealed key patterns in the data, such as correlations between certain municipal issues and geographic areas.</li>
    <li>We proposed and implemented a real-time data visualization tool using Streamlit, which helped the municipality identify and address these issues more efficiently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Skills Gained:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data cleaning and preparation</strong> using Python and SQL to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> to uncover key trends and correlations in the municipal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Application development and deployment</strong> using Streamlit to build a real-time data visualization tool for the client.</li>
    <li><strong>Project management</strong> and communication skills in a team setting, ensuring collaboration and meeting client expectations.</li>
  </ul>
