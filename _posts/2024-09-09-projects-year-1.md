### Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, we focused on analyzing a dataset provided by our instructor. The goal was to extract insights and present them visually using various data analysis techniques. We were given four weeks to complete the project, which involved cleaning the data, conducting exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations.

**Skills Achieved:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Creating and sharing dashboards using Power BI.

### Dashboard

Below is the interactive Power BI dashboard that was the final deliverable for this project.
