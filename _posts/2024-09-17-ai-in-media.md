  <p>As part of a five-person team at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUAS), we explored the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on students, staff, and the organization. Our mixed-method study combined surveys and interviews to investigate attitudes towards AI within media studies. The project concluded with a research paper, policy recommendations, and an interactive PowerPoint presentation presented at a conference, providing actionable insights and strategic direction.</p>

  <h4>Data Collection & Analysis:</h4>
  <p>I played a significant role in the data collection phase by creating a comprehensive survey using Qualtrics. Additionally, my team and I conducted in-depth interviews with lecturers and students, gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. The survey data was preprocessed using R scripting, which allowed me to perform a detailed analysis and uncover valuable trends and patterns.</p>

  <h4>Visualization & Presentation:</h4>
  <p>Utilizing R scripting, my team and I developed visualizations, such as dynamic charts and interactive graphs, to effectively communicate our findings. We culminated our efforts by developing a PowerPoint presentation, which was showcased at the conference, highlighting our research results and actionable recommendations.</p>

  <h4>Stakeholder Collaboration:</h4>
  <p>Our team maintained active engagement with Media stakeholders to ensure our study aligned with industry needs. Regular meetings facilitated our progress, fostering meaningful outcomes and targeted recommendations for the BUAS community.</p>

  <h4>Impact & Personal Growth:</h4>
  <p>The project provided valuable insights to BUAS for enhancing Media studies and helped me grow as an analytics translator. I developed my expertise in data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and strategic problem-solving. Additionally, it deepened my understanding of research methodologies, data collection, and analysis using R.</p>
