  <p>For this project, we were approached by <strong>Banijay</strong>, a leading content creation company, to analyze their television viewership data. Banijay provided us with detailed datasets related to their TV shows, including air dates, hosts, viewership ratings, and social media engagement data. My task was to develop a machine learning model that could predict TV show ratings based on this data, with the goal of helping Banijay enhance their data usage and ultimately increase their ratings.</p>

  <p>After receiving the data from Banijay, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, which allowed me to identify key trends and relationships in the data. I then proceeded to develop machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, to predict viewership ratings based on the features extracted from the data. The final outcome of my analysis was delivered back to Banijay, along with actionable insights to help them optimize their content and ratings.</p>

  <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Social media engagement, particularly metrics like retweets and likes on Twitter, had a significant correlation with the ratings of the show.</li>
    <li>The analysis revealed that certain hosts were consistently more popular, which positively influenced the show's ratings.</li>
    <li>Linear Regression performed better than the Decision Tree model in predicting the ratings, with an R-squared value of 0.93 compared to 0.89 for the Decision Tree model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Skills Gained:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data cleaning and preparation</strong> by merging multiple datasets and handling missing values to ensure the data was ready for analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> using Python to identify key trends in viewership and social media metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning model development</strong> by implementing Linear Regression and Decision Tree models to predict TV ratings.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical considerations</strong> in data handling, ensuring all data used complied with GDPR standards, and reflecting on the broader implications of using social media data for predictive analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The final model and insights were delivered back to <strong>Banijay</strong>, providing them with actionable recommendations on how to leverage social media data and optimize their host selection to improve TV show ratings.</p>
