00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That everyone is here.</v>

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I will start to stand up.</v>

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.520
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I'm starting with Max.</v>

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>What did you do the past few days?</v>

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, honestly, not that much.</v>

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, fair enough.</v>

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>No, sorry I didn't do that much.</v>

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Is there notice fine?</v>

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Is there something specifically blocking you?</v>

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I just don't know quite exactly what to work on.</v>

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>There.</v>

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It's not well explained by the teachers.</v>

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>No, I agree.</v>

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I will tell you what we will work.</v>

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We'll be working on today, so I'm gonna skip that question.</v>

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK. Umm.</v>

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Marwa, what did you work on?</v>

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.630
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Or same as Max.</v>

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Same as Max.</v>

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I just don't know how to start.</v>

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, so also confused with.</v>

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, lack of information from the teachers.</v>

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And for Michael same.</v>

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>A bit. Yeah.</v>

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, I'll try to look for some data set, but yeah, it's more or less the same with everyone.</v>

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK fine, I did rework my question a bit, so I'm not sure if you guys wanna resee my PowerPoint.</v>

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, then I'm gonna share.</v>

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>My screen.</v>

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Can you guys see my screen? OK.</v>

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh, wait, I think you're in there now.</v>

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, everyone is in the Trello, so that's good.</v>

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, so I reworked my research question to be what is the correlation between immigration and educational outcomes in different neighborhoods?</v>

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then the same as I had.</v>

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>How can data different insights from an AI model contributes to improving education in these neighborhoods?</v>

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And instead of predictive model, since we already have the data from the past few years, it's very easy to predict.</v>

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's gonna be pretty similar to the last years.</v>

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I thought either a regression or a causal inference model could be helpful.</v>

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Not sure if you guys agree but and I also changed that on the AI canvas.</v>

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But yeah, that's what I changed.</v>

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.780
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I will do that.</v>

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Could you maybe send a simple differentiation as well so that we can 2?</v>

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I'll do that after the meeting. So.</v>

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yes, sure.</v>

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, let me see.</v>

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But uh, if is that the theme we wanna go for or do we still wanna go with Max's theme from public nuisance?</v>

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But honestly, I I think I need to read it like slowly.</v>

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What do you need to do?</v>

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, like that?</v>

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>To read it slowly like to like once again, you know no sleeping.</v>

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I mean, you do have my PowerPoint presentation, right?</v>

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Oh, that one, OK.</v>

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, I'm talking about Esas now, the new one, yeah.</v>

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, that's fair.</v>

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Personally, I like Esau's team more, mainly because like I have more more personal interests that into it.</v>

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I basically combine it with your research question.</v>

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Let's see if I can find my.</v>

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I can't find it right now, but I will add that shortly after the guy that's see Ohm Michael is in Trello, so that's done.</v>

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Did you all join the shared GitHub repository?</v>

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No, not here.</v>

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>No, I don't.</v>

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.700
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I have not yet.</v>

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.920
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, so if you go to the general teams, I think Dean shared a message.</v>

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.370
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>See general.</v>

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.860
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I already made one, so you just have to join the one that says Team 10.</v>

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And we just click the link didn't provide and then then.</v>

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I think you can.</v>

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Then it allows you to choose which repository to choose.</v>

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, you want to join.</v>

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yup.</v>

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Team 10 rides.</v>

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Kingdom.</v>

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.320
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Ready to Go, Team 10.</v>

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, got it.</v>

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.840
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, good.</v>

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>You tell me.</v>

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Let's add that to my favorites.</v>

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh.</v>

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Tech.</v>

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>You have time for sure.</v>

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Done.</v>

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.670
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Are the others in there too?</v>

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.160
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>You know.</v>

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK good.</v>

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I am uploading my uh presentation now.</v>

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I think it's there.</v>

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's the newest one.</v>

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.170
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's in the files from Team 10.</v>

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>See.</v>

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>There's nothing in there yet.</v>

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Cheese.</v>

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.090
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, just uploaded a few seconds ago.</v>

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.960
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>1.</v>

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Nothing in there yet will probably pop up in a few seconds.</v>

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It will pop up.</v>

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, uh, I think it's best if we read through it.</v>

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Not not while calling that that doesn't have to be well calling but and then decide before around 12:30.</v>

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.200
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm.</v>

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.540
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Which thing we wanna go with because then we can still fill in the Trello page because I need to present it to Ahmet free.</v>

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.080
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Just mute.</v>

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.880
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Do we have to change the layout of the Trello board?</v>

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Because this? Yeah.</v>

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We might, because Alican did share a how he wanted it to look like.</v>

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I did add the Sprint planning boards, but I think he wanted something else too.</v>

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.860
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.860
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:27.300
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And we also, I'm gonna look at that, but we also need to do a risk assessment and something for legal and ethics, some use cases.</v>

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But I will look at that.</v>

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.220
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Alright.</v>

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I guess, yeah.</v>

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.020
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Your concern is still not in the GitHub page, by the way.</v>

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's not.</v>

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.330
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>No, you'll probably uh, uploaded it to your own GitHub.</v>

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh no, I uploaded it to team.</v>

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Sorry.</v>

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh.</v>

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, teams, that's why.</v>

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, but I can also upload it to GitHub.</v>

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It's also not in teams.</v>

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.750
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Not Susan.</v>

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Not in there.</v>

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, it's uh in files not filed.</v>

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh there.</v>

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.190
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Let's see.</v>

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So it's all in a new post or something.</v>

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, got it.</v>

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>These are thing.</v>

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But it's.</v>

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:49.980
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So what do we all have to do today?</v>

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:03.670
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, today at three, we have the Sprint planning with Ali, John and I need to because I'm the scrum master.</v>

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And then.</v>

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I will present to him our Trello page, so this Sprint planning the product backlog and the what is it called?</v>

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.530
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, the other thing.</v>

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:18.780
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm.</v>

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But yeah, so we need to.</v>

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.350
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But we meet him all, like all of us here.</v>

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like join the meeting you're presenting, but we are all there.</v>

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That what you mean?</v>

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I think we all need to be there.</v>

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, OK.</v>

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's just that I am the spokesperson.</v>

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:39.070
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And then then we OK and all this meeting we will like, yeah, I figure it out.</v>

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Set the plan for what to do the next day.</v>

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.840
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Six so that we all have some job to do.</v>

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.710
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>We'll stay right.</v>

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, basically.</v>

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.320
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That maybe it's like for now, it's pretty at least that's how I feel like pretty confusing.</v>

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.550
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But two, start with what?</v>

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.210
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I think if we choose a theme quickly then we can fill in the Trello page.</v>

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>At least to a certain extent.</v>

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So do product backlog and what we want to do this week?</v>

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I think that's just data preprocessing, so that should be fine and I will look at the risk assessment and the legal and ethics use cases.</v>

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So it would be helpful if you freedom can fill into Trello page.</v>

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.450
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's just general stuff like the data preprocessing.</v>

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.510
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.510
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Alright.</v>

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.580
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Can do.</v>

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.700
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Candu 3.</v>

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.270
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I don't mind which fever picking.</v>

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.620
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I I like Max's.</v>

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.490
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>'S I like mine.</v>

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.030
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I don't mind.</v>

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.250
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'm also fine with yours.</v>

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I don't really care.</v>

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:40.780
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Hello.</v>

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.680
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>For me, it's yours is.</v>

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.670
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>You're the problem.</v>

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.180
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So we have to fill in the Sprint planning or what do we have to do?</v>

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, at least for a week one.</v>

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.180
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>What we want to achieve in one week for the Sprint, so the I think for this week they also made some sort of.</v>

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.380
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And it says for week four's data preparation, so just that.</v>

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>See week four planner first Sprint with your product owner together.</v>

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Online teams are with their consent.</v>

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Otherwise, evidence by the 1st Sprint, let's see.</v>

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm, what did I work on yesterday when I working on today and what issues are blocking me?</v>

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.760
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, basically what we we're doing that now, we already did that.</v>

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Oh yeah, we talked about it.</v>

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.610
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:55.270
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So what needs to be into Trello page is just data preparation, so gathering the data and then whatever needs to be cleaned or merged and that's what we're doing this week.</v>

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No.</v>

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.980
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I think for first Sprint that should be doable, right? OK.</v>

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm, so this week we're just looking for data.</v>

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.350
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's it.</v>

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, and already cleaning and merging and preparing it to be used.</v>

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But what what will be like the goal you're going to be like dashboard and model?</v>

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, dashboards and a model.</v>

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.720
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So if we're picking mine, it's probably a regression model.</v>

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, big relevant data for that.</v>

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'm fine with that.</v>

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.860
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>You know.</v>

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Me.</v>

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.640
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Is everyone fine with my theme then or OK?</v>

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yes, ma'am.</v>

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Let's see.</v>

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.300
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So we're doing everything in Python.</v>

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.140
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>We did.</v>

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.140
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>We we're we're not gonna make a dashboard or something.</v>

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.240
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>There we are.</v>

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.380
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Is it?</v>

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Is it necessary?</v>

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We, we we could make a dashboard, but I think the model is necessary.</v>

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.110
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>The dashboard is optional so.</v>

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.700
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>But it gives you like a higher grade though.</v>

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.980
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, true.</v>

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We could make a dashboard.</v>

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>If it gets us a higher grade and I'm down for it, but.</v>

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.990
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, maybe then we can like split the like tasks somehow.</v>

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:08.270
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm.</v>

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:13.770
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like, do you guys feel like a better with doing that sports or what would you what you're what you think?</v>

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.670
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean.</v>

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.380
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'm actually fine with both.</v>

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.780
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, I already have.</v>

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh, nice.</v>

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.310
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>OK.</v>

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, like a layout for my dashboards like I could use my previous layout from block a I think and yeah, we just have to modify it, alter it.</v>

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, that could work.</v>

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:40.100
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, for me personally, I I like doing like I could do more.</v>

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That sure.</v>

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.780
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh towards the like model, so I can't speak more.</v>

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And what do you prefer, Marwa?</v>

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Umm, I guess the dashboard.</v>

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So me and Marwa will work on the dashboard and YouTube will work on the Python on the on the coding stuff for now.</v>

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, but I think this week we don't have to do the coding stuff yet, so.</v>

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, just like we'll have probably the same data.</v>

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.990
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>We'll just later use it differently here 20.</v>

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.640
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.260
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, exactly.</v>

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:26.400
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So we just have to look for data now and uh, the ones who use who will use Python will have to clean it because we OK, cool.</v>

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Work like what was there like done London in progress?</v>

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Something like this.</v>

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.220
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Do you remember that?</v>

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Maybe like, how did he categorize the the task?</v>

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.050
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.520
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Do you remember when we had Lego like the Scrum workshop on Friday?</v>

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Bert was sticking like some tasks on the like.</v>

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, stick notes on the board.</v>

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Oh yeah.</v>

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>He had numbers 12358 and 13 or something like that.</v>

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.680
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, yeah, that was the like priority.</v>

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.670
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But he also would stick them in some like 3 categories.</v>

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I think like the like tasks two to be done in progress and done.</v>

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Still, the OR still have to be done in progress and completed.</v>

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.220
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.360
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that's what we can do in the the board, I think.</v>

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.250
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.210
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No.</v>

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:42.630
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Well, you can add the tasks like searching for data preprocessing, data, merging the data, stuff like that.</v>

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I think it's I, aside from the obvious confusion from the teachers, but it's pretty clear now, right?</v>

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>So far, yeah.</v>

00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.230
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:16:59.420 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I've.</v>

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But if there are any questions, do send them to me in what step or something?</v>

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Because then I can ask Ali shown in the meeting.</v>

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:07.510
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No.</v>

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.540
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.470
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, you want.</v>

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.850
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's fine.</v>

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.340
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm.</v>

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, so if all of that is clear, I'm probably gonna leave and focus on the legal and risk assessments and then you can work on the Trello page.</v>

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.520
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>You know, thank you.</v>

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Will do.</v>

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes, OK.</v>

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And so see you at 3:30.</v>

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.540
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>If you need me in the meeting, then just text me and I'll be there.</v>

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Well.</v>

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you, I really like the design, so I like to set up.</v>

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.360

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.290
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Umm.</v>
