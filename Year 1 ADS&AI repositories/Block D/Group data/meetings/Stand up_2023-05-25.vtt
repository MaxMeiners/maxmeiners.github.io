00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Hey, guys.</v>

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Hi.</v>

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>How are you guys doing?</v>

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>How do you think?</v>

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Pretty I'm pretty OK.</v>

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Is Max here though.</v>

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I think he's gone.</v>

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, yeah, you should be coming.</v>

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Is one of you at school today?</v>

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>No, I'm at home.</v>

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.240
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>OK.</v>

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Me too.</v>

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Let me just quickly text Max.</v>

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No.</v>

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But he slipping.</v>

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh, you said.</v>

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh ****, I forgot.</v>

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, he's going.</v>

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I mean it's it's just a standoff.</v>

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So it's only like 10 minutes and then we have our presentation at 4:15 I think.</v>

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>So how are we going to do that?</v>

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Umm, I think we only need to be there from 4:15, so we don't need to join the whole meeting from 2:00 to 5:00.</v>

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And I think the whole group needs to be there, but I guess only one person could present and I could do that.</v>

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>OK.</v>

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>You know, are you guys turning on your camera during the presentation?</v>

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Because I don't have a webcam and I don't wanna be only person like without.</v>

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I'm sharing my screen with the PowerPoint, so yeah, you can just.</v>

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I don't have the jacket with me, but yeah.</v>

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, let yeah.</v>

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I will see what month does if he turns off all the rest of probably.</v>

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>You know that one.</v>

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I don't think it's necessary to put your camera on.</v>

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah, but it feels rude not to for some reason.</v>

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I mean, if they ask, you can always say that you don't have a webcam.</v>

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Lasso literally forgot about it.</v>

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Hi, that's fine.</v>

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That's fine.</v>

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Just want to do a quick stand up like planned and then we can work on the stuff.</v>

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Sure.</v>

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Let's start with more about today.</v>

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Marwa, what did you do yesterday?</v>

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I've been working on the data framework like answering the legal and ethics questions.</v>

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So like use case one, I think, right, OK.</v>

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And that's going well.</v>

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.170
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>So far yes, but I'm still kind of confused because I I still don't have a list of all the data that we're going to use for this project, so I'm not sure how to answer some questions.</v>

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>So like a list of all the data that we're going to use would be nice.</v>

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So yeah, I've some of you either Michael or Mexican, send it in the chats.</v>

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>What you are going to use right now?</v>

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The data.</v>

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>The where you where you gathered from.</v>

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh.</v>

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yesterday I talked with Irene and Bram about uh, some data we can use for our.</v>

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And what's it called for a question?</v>

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.610
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Research question and they gave me some interesting things we could use.</v>

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh.</v>

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.650
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>OK.</v>

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So I wanna talk about that a little bit later this meeting.</v>

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That's that's fine.</v>

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Umm.</v>

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.480
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Then second question is something blocking you?</v>

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, aside from this.</v>

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.740
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>No, I don't think so.</v>

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>As far as things going on.</v>

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And what are you going to do today?</v>

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.050
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I'm finishing a use case one.</v>

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, that's good.</v>

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And the the presentation, of course.</v>

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Presentation.</v>

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, Michael, what did you do yesterday?</v>

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, good.</v>

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So as as always say looked for data and actually I have some some useful ones on crime and nuisance reports.</v>

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And also like on social economics factors, so that can be useful.</v>

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, that's nice.</v>

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm yeah.</v>

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, specifically, OK.</v>

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And So what I'm going to do, what's blocking me and probably those other find a lot of data, but it's often like generally for the whole Netherlands or like the regions, it's hard to find something for Breda, but yeah.</v>

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that's the thing.</v>

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.540
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then today?</v>

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, I would hope to find more.</v>

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Some, like some data, maybe on some news reports for example, or something about public transport safety like this is like some indirect factors that may.</v>

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, that's maybe useful for all research question.</v>

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then Max, you did a lot yesterday.</v>

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So tell us what you did.</v>

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yes.</v>

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So I worked on a that Geo Panda stuff which is ******* difficult, but I kind of know what to do now.</v>

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, good.</v>

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, I managed to combine two different data sets, but I still have to like visualize them in Geo pandas or using Geo pandas.</v>

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>And that.</v>

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So I'm gonna work on that today.</v>

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And yesterday I talked with Irene and Bram about uh, that I just don't know where to look for data.</v>

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.040
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And then I don't know what data to use, so they gave me some.</v>

00:05:50.210 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The information or a data sets that I could use that are, uh, that could be important for our research question and we could look for a UM, what's it called?</v>

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Data from the Livability index.</v>

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.210
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So we need to look for data from that we could look for.</v>

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.840
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh green index.</v>

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.230
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Umm.</v>

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Because, uh, if you think about hobos, for example, hobos cuts live more in areas with where the green index is higher than in areas where the green index is lower.</v>

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That's fair.</v>

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.170
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>True.</v>

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.190
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh.</v>

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That's yeah. OK.</v>

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So something like that we could use a lot of data from the police database like they told us already.</v>

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>We could use geographical data and data from the bar registrations.</v>

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, so a lot of the uh.</v>

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I mean.</v>

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep, we could also use data from the data set data played out.</v>

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, I don't know.</v>

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.350
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, move house?</v>

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.310
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Are we talking about?</v>

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>You could also you could also use data from yeah a lot.</v>

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So we need.</v>

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.710
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I mean, I have a data folder of registrated public nuisance of of like the last 10 years.</v>

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I think I could share that with you guys.</v>

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I think you could use it.</v>

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.320
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's OK.</v>

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, that will be.</v>

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, just share it into this chest.</v>

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.390
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah, like I'll, I also, yeah, sure.</v>

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I also find data yesterday, but like I wasn't sure if it was so like a valid for this question about uh police reaction time and the different neighborhoods.</v>

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.320
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>And Britta, I don't know if we could use that.</v>

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.350
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And I guess that.</v>

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.560
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'll be right back if you.</v>

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>SEC.</v>

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.750
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>What?</v>

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'm in the kitchen.</v>

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>OK.</v>

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.110
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's.</v>

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>May.</v>

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>What happened?</v>

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Block my young broke.</v>

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.420
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>No.</v>

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yet.</v>

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>What did he do?</v>

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.980
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, OK, so we could use data from those data sets.</v>

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So green index, livability, index data, Prada, they also added the new data set, which is called map of 100 meters by 100 meters, with statistics from the CBS.</v>

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Right.</v>

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Which I also, uh, implemented in the geopend stuff on VS code.</v>

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm.</v>

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.680
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Heat stress index.</v>

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:51.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>You could also use uh, for example, in areas where the heat is higher or lower than in other areas, I hobos tend to live.</v>

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Almost.</v>

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Longer or more?</v>

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.750
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>When it's OK.</v>

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And I'll when we have combined all that data we could.</v>

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Visualize it in a correlation matrix.</v>

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.650
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Sounds good.</v>

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.350
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>No.</v>

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.950
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Like we did and I think block see.</v>

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like because.</v>

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So that's what Bram told me.</v>

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, so this is nice like right now.</v>

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, this is definitely useful.</v>

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I think we lacked the data like that's about some factors and now you give a lot of ideas, but that's yeah.</v>

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Soda correlation matrix is one thing we have to do, which is which can be really important.</v>

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.790
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Umm yeah.</v>

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Data from CBS uh data override stuff like that.</v>

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, we still have a lot to do, like a lot.</v>

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.630
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:58.250
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, but yeah, we have first have to present it to them anyway, and they will, I think if it's feedback or ask questions and we can.</v>

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:58.810
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Listen to what they want.</v>

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.310
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Right.</v>

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.670
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>You're good.</v>

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh, and I'm almost forgetting myself, but what I did yesterday was basically the risk assessments.</v>

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I'm almost done with it, so I identified the risk.</v>

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.720
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I assess the risks.</v>

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.540
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Sounds good.</v>

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Is there a place for that?</v>

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I added some mitigations and for now I have put most of them in the monitoring tab, but I will have to see those checklists again because I had to change a few of them because we changed the research question so I will finish up today and also prepare the presentation because I will present and yeah, if you guys need any help you can also text me.</v>

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Do you have to do like actually presentation like PowerPoint and do everything from scratch?</v>

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Or is there some signal template for the?</v>

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh what?</v>

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.600
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>What do you mean but?</v>

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh.</v>

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Brown said in in teams is just use the pitch template we used for Ali Chong.</v>

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Umm.</v>

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Did you already change that template that I gave you?</v>

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, yeah, I worked on that.</v>

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Ohh and you also put in data and stuff.</v>

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.030
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I still have to put in data because I don't.</v>

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I don't have the data yet.</v>

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I mean just just an example.</v>

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Thanks.</v>

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I will.</v>

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:23.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Or you can also put in all the data datasets we are going to use like data from green index with ability, stuff like that.</v>

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.980
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I will.</v>

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I will add that before the presentation.</v>

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that's it's today.</v>

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'm by the way, gonna work on the geopend a stuff.</v>

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.530
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Alright.</v>

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:47.140
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Trying to get that to work and if I can get that to work, I'll probably work on something else, but I'm not sure what yet.</v>

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.310
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I think getting at least use case one finished of legal and then risk assessment finished presentation done and most of the data gathering I think we should be fine for tomorrow.</v>

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.320
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then tomorrow we'll meet at 9.</v>

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.620
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>At school we have the fair review.</v>

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:08.490
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And we have to fill that in in the morning for each other and then we have the Sprint review.</v>

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:12.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.050
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.980
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Sounds good, no?</v>

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep, cool.</v>

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.120
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Then I'll leave you guys to it if you need anything, just text me.</v>

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I can help with other stuff too.</v>

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.540
