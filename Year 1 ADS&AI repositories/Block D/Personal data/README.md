# Block D - Team-based  - Individual Repo

Block D is the capstone course of the propaedeutic stage of your bachelor degree where you are asked to do a full CRISP-DM cycle in a small group which should result in some kind of data science product like a dashboard, model, package or application. Next to working as a team, you will also need to keep track of your individual contribution and group collaboration. But to start of, you will also complete several knowledge modules individually and prepare several small project proposals to your group in week 3. You'll then select/combine ideas and start working as a group from then onwards. Many of the dynamics will therefore change in this block:

- [ ] Groupwork replaces individual work, but assessment will still be done on your individual contribution;
- [ ] The assessment of your groupwork skills are an explicit element of the assessment in this block;
- [ ] Less emphasis is put on delivery of knowledge and skills. Self-guided learning (under supervision) is the new standard;
- [ ] Skills training mainly consists of project management, communication and working in teams;

As a result, you will spend most of your time on your project as a team. Before you start working in a team though, you will first have to complete you individual part consisting of an legal review, an EDA using Python and SQL, which culminates in a Project Proposal Presentation which you present on Wednesday Week 3. You will each present at least 1 project idea substantiated by your EDA and your legal review. Then, your team will pick one of the project ideas and start working them as a team from then onwards. More on that later.

This block will focus on the __*Deployment*__ phase of the __*CRISP-DM*__ lifecycle; you will learn how to deploy your model or application! Last block, you've learned how to justify the development of a project by creating a project proposal which you backed up with a substantiated design and proof-of-concept. Now, you're going to again propose a project but based on your EDA and the specific client requirements instead. They're open, they don't really know what they want, they just want 'tools' to solve the problems. This happens more often in industry, 'we have data and we have problems, and we think the data can solve our problems but we don't know how'; difficult for us as unclarity and abstraction makes it difficult to judge what to do... However, these situation do give us more agency and creativity to solve a problem so let's get started **creating something we can deploy!**
