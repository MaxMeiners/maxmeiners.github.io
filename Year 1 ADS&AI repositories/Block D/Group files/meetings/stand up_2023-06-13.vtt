00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Okay, is that? What did you uh do yesterday? What are you going to do today? And did you run into any problems?</v>

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, well, yesterday I made those line charts, but today I was already working on adding some more. I will show you.</v>

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I now combine it into one bar chart for each neighbourhood.</v>

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>It looks very nice.</v>

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then you can select each neighbourhood and then see what's happening over there, yeah.</v>

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'll take a look at it in a SEC.</v>

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Like you, I have these separately, but I I guess making it into one Fishel is maybe more.</v>

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Concise.</v>

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'll take a look at it. Ohh, let's see.</v>

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Okay yeah.</v>

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Ohh.</v>

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Ohh I see. Cool.</v>

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, like I had these, but I think making it just one clear chart makes it better.</v>

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What do you mean?</v>

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I.</v>

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Like I have three of these visuals separately for total crime, so it'll nuisance unemployment, but this is everything for the neighbourhood in one chart.</v>

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh huh.</v>

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I I'm not sure if it's more clear, but yeah.</v>

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Me this.</v>

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Drop down menu where you can select what kind of uh.</v>

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Ohh yeah.</v>

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What do you want to visualise like total crime cell, the nuisance so drunk like that?</v>

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, right. The chicken select or deselect them, right?</v>

<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK. Yeah. I will do that. Then I will keep I guess only this one and then make it select and deselect instead of like having these three.</v>

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that's cool. Like and making it making the drop down menu or something like that is not that difficult.</v>

<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>They are deployed the machine learning Streamlets I created like a virtual environment with poetry and bit like the lynching and the code format thing so that we should meet two more IOSI think.</v>

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And I also started doing the unit testing, which is really problematic for me, at least right now. I guess like a lot of errors, there's like one thing. So I can say it's my problem.</v>

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Hmm.</v>

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.070

<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.650
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Just like I don't know if I should also do the unit test for some like.</v>

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Um, models that were only.</v>

<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Hmm.</v>

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.070
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Not like, you know, not that deliverable, but only like some.</v>

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Testing so I don't know what they mean by it.</v>

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.770
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Do you already have an? Do you already have an idea on how to how to fix your problem, or are you just gonna wait for for Dean?</v>

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.930
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>No, I will try to do something for.</v>

<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, so the question for me what I did yesterday.</v>

00:06:48.790 --> 00:07:02.920
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I worked on putting in more more charts in streamlet. I did run into a problem with creating one line chart because it looks like crap.</v>

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But I have to go go to Alicante tomorrow or Irene to ask them if they can help me.</v>

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And I filled in some of the ilos on um on the PowerPoint presentation, the learning log, and I further improved the map visuals and Michael Michael's saw what what I changed. I added a slider on top of the.</v>

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>On top of the map charts.</v>

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Or met facials. And whenever you select a year, the map automatically changes to that specific year.</v>

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So yeah, that's what I did.</v>

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And the problem I ran into was of course the.</v>

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Um, the fish was like creating.</v>

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The line chart and bar chart.</v>

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But that's what I'm gonna.</v>

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh do tomorrow and later today. I'm probably gonna.</v>

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Um.</v>

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Figure out how to.</v>

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Fix a line chart myself and if I am unable to do that, I'll just go to Alicante tomorrow.</v>

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that's it.</v>

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>If you fix it, do we have enough charts and maps to just start putting them into stream? Little like finish them the dashboard? Or do we need to?</v>

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.790
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Visualise something else.</v>

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I don't think we have to visualise something else. If you guys think we have to, then please let me know. But I don't think we have to.</v>

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, OK, let's just.</v>

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I mean I it's do we have enough visuals now in order to answer our research question?</v>

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.930
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, I think like the correlation matrix will be the most.</v>

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.070
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Useful for the.</v>

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.730
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But there is question because it will actually what's what are the most important?</v>

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.010
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>The correlations the factors.</v>

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And besides all that, yeah, we can just put the.</v>

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.810
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>The visual, so I think we have enough.</v>

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:20.770
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Okay, but there's nothing else we can we we need in order to answer our research question.</v>

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Or is there?</v>

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Don't think so.</v>

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Okay, that's cool.</v>

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, me neither.</v>

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>No, I think we're done with that.</v>

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It's.</v>

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I hope.</v>

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Anything else I can I can do later today?</v>

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>She's in your learning book.</v>

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.030
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's it.</v>

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Cool.</v>

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:57.160
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, we so tomorrow we can. I think all try to get talk and.</v>

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.220
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>The third deploying all the visuals right.</v>

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.240
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Hmm.</v>

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.840
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>This timely.</v>

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.040
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So yeah, but we I guess we need to talk about this and we can maybe.</v>

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>With the the task now.</v>

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.230
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I don't know, no idea, but this.</v>

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Good. That's for free.</v>

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Then I will just work on my learning lock and the visuals later today.</v>

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.400
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, cool.</v>

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:30.280
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>You like try to have them ready so that tomorrow we can start picking doing just that final dash weather working.</v>

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That's what I would say.</v>

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.950
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that's OK. I'll try to fix them. But if I if I can, I will have to go to other channel, but.</v>

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:38.740
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Okay.</v>

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I'll try to fix it anyways.</v>

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK. Then I think that's.</v>

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's the meeting we came to the end of the meeting.</v>

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And I wish you all good luck.</v>

<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I didn't get some card by by accident. I don't know what? What card?</v>

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.670

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I I can see it.</v>

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.250

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.250
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's it's been fixed.</v>

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Go to work. Don't ask me any question.</v>

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Ohh ****.</v>

<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Hi.</v>

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.830
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Tell.</v>

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Hi.</v>
