00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I mean, that's already sounds like a lot.</v>

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So that's good.</v>

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh to edit my smart goals because Trump said you have to and put a goal for each letter of the of the of the word smarter.</v>

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And I haven't done that yet.</v>

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Right.</v>

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, true.</v>

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Also, don't forget to like have at least one technical goal and one personal OK.</v>

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, OK.</v>

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh.</v>

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Then As for me, I also filled in my work log and learning log and all that stuff, and I also worked on the road map so that it contains all the cards from the Sprint planning.</v>

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I think it looks pretty OK, but if you guys have any comments or things you want to change, just tell me and I will.</v>

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, for now.</v>

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The road map looks the same as the Sprint planning.</v>

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.210
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, but it's kind of the yeah.</v>

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.980
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Do you wanna like weekly or?</v>

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It's probably best if you put it in weekly.</v>

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Because then I will have to remember what was when.</v>

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>We could help you with that.</v>

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.240
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And when you can, yeah.</v>

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.870
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Because for now it just, yeah.</v>

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.910
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Because now it now it looks like exactly the same.</v>

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's the.</v>

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's just what I mean by it.</v>

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, because I did put it into the tab.</v>

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It belongs to and then in the order.</v>

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We kind of did it.</v>

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So yeah, you start with the data collecting and then we kind of did legal and effects mostly the model.</v>

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh-huh.</v>

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>And then we're still basically streamlined, but I will try to do it weekly if that's better.</v>

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, yeah, that's it.</v>

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Today I didn't run into any problems and I wanted to uh, yeah.</v>

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Meet tomorrow for basically everything.</v>

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Just putting it together, checking each other's ilos, see if everything's OK with evidencing streamlet.</v>

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That kind of stuff.</v>

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.850
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Alright.</v>
