00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, it's working OK.</v>

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Isaac, start with you.</v>

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What have you done yesterday?</v>

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.760
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What are you planning on going to do today?</v>

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And did you run into any problems and what you did yesterday?</v>

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Can you show us on the screen?</v>

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yes.</v>

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Let's see.</v>

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yesterday I fixed a bar chart that I also added the an Easter egg for it and I mostly worked on the peer review because I hadn't done that in like 3 weeks.</v>

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So I had to do that.</v>

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I can't show you the peer review, but I can show you the parture.</v>

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I don't.</v>

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I don't wanna see the pair of you, but it's just a bar chart and Easter egg and stuff.</v>

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>We need.</v>

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I mean otherwise blown will hit me if I show you the peer review.</v>

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But like OK, I updated it I.</v>

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that I saw and I did change a little bit of code.</v>

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So when you click on the scripture, I don't know if I if I uploaded it yet.</v>

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So if you click on the scription.</v>

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Oh yes.</v>

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, OK.</v>

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Now you have to click on the scription twice, so I changed that for you, but I didn't upload it yet, so so that's what I changed about it.</v>

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, that's good.</v>

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But yeah, if you click on the neighborhood, our school is located in, then it will give you the balloons, but only for that neighborhood.</v>

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, that's cool.</v>

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>So if you just go to baleful or something, it doesn't do that like it's a fun little detail.</v>

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But yeah, and yeah, the peer reviewer.</v>

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I had action points.</v>

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I had the summary so it took me quite a while.</v>

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>No, looks good, but if you are, can you click on the scription again?</v>

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And that one again.</v>

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So now when you deselect unemployment, for example on the left hand side.</v>

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, yes.</v>

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Click mate.</v>

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, it's still shows when you click on the scription.</v>

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, right?</v>

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I should change that.</v>

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It still shows the three factors, so maybe it's, uh, uh could be nice to change.</v>

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, I will do that.</v>

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That only shows the one selected so that, but other than that it looks fine.</v>

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>The update is code is on GitHub.</v>

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What updated code?</v>

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>For the description, because you.</v>

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, yeah.</v>

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Let's see.</v>

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Where is it?</v>

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Where is it barchart?</v>

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Merchant was.</v>

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Because then I will. Yeah.</v>

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, they changed it.</v>

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So let's save it again and I'll upload it.</v>

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh updates to streamlets uh.</v>

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, uploading it now.</v>

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, it's just uploaded it.</v>

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.860
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So let's start.</v>

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I see it.</v>

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.710
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK then I will fix that and we should and the evidence thing today, right?</v>

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Come again?</v>

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.260
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, if.</v>

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We we're gonna do the evidence thing too, right?</v>

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.530
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I just shouldn't be.</v>

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.500
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, good thing to do like other channel will want for sure to to see it, I guess.</v>

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, it will give us some.</v>

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The stream with needs to be done by today.</v>

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's what I know for sure.</v>

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.910
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, basically, yeah.</v>

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But most of it we've done already, we just need to combine it into one uh Python file, but it's quite easy to do.</v>

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Umm.</v>

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, like I have to do the unit testing of streaming as well.</v>

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.260
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But to start doing it, I like need to have streamlined finished like so that there are no no more changes.</v>

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Just like if we change something then all the unit tests like go ********.</v>

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>True.</v>

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like I've got the.</v>

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, it's just sorry.</v>

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So with that.</v>

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>UM, OK.</v>

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Did you run into any problems yesterday?</v>

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What are you gonna do today?</v>

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK, no problems and today I will fix what you just asked me to do and I thought it would be smart to evidence together.</v>

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>But I'm not sure when we will do it or if we will just finish Streamlet first.</v>

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, and now?</v>

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.700
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Until what time can you work on school?</v>

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Uh, until whenever?</v>

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>All day.</v>

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Same here.</v>

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Same here.</v>

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Same.</v>

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I was thinking about uh working until like 8 or 9.</v>

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, I mean, I can call in the evening.</v>

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>It's for evidencing, I don't mind.</v>

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, that's cool.</v>

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It's called, yeah.</v>

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But like.</v>

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>I mean, especially for like free until seven, like ilos free until seven.</v>

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>We need to do it together, I think.</v>

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Through you.</v>

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, like it's there's no point in, like, it's nonsense for each of us to do it separately because it's, you're like evidencing that project, not the.</v>

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.040
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That's the same thing.</v>

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, we need to do it together.</v>

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, basically.</v>

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So that's that.</v>

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And yeah, I'll be at school around maybe 2:30 to 2:30.</v>

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Then I'll keep on working as well.</v>

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, I don't.</v>

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.600
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.960
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So that's that on to Michael.</v>

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.250
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Are you on your phone or are you on your laptop?</v>

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And So what I've done yesterday, Allison told me to this phone.</v>

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, never mind then.</v>

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.650
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Both, I mean like.</v>

<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah, please.</v>

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.860
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And she said no.</v>

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh uh, what have you done yesterday?</v>

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I'll Shan told me to rebuild the model.</v>

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.710
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that's for the like inputs for the prediction.</v>

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.930
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>We don't use the year at all, but yeah, like to limit our predictions only for next year.</v>

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that to eliminate the your input.</v>

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.380
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.370
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So most rebuilding the the model and and then like the adjusting the streaming page.</v>

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So it looks like this and it's doesn't give the, uh, some years values should.</v>

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Although the bubble is the only one that doesn't.</v>

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And this.</v>

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Above all, is just really, really weird bloki as well, yeah.</v>

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.230
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Or they are super side?</v>

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.900
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>No.</v>

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.240
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I don't know. Hey.</v>

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, make sure when when presenting to not select blah OK or bavel.</v>

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, like this.</v>

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.050
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, just pick one that works.</v>

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Just any other.</v>

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>OK.</v>

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, those were.</v>

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, so so this and I just one thing and I started doing the unit testing for the model.</v>

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So I think that should be OK for the model, but yeah, we also need to.</v>

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Umm.</v>

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, we also need them for stream late, so that will be for each each page.</v>

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.540
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Just like we knew a new file, so it will be a bit of work.</v>

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So I guess I will try to finish this.</v>

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh till the end of the weekend because if we finish today this terminate then I will start tomorrow.</v>

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep.</v>

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>We're tremely and yeah, that's what.</v>

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So what's easier for you to 1st finish Streamlight or to just do the learning log and finish three minute later today?</v>

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Honestly, it doesn't matter like I can do either.</v>

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.990
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>First.</v>

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's up to you.</v>

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, I can do the learning clock at least like my part.</v>

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>For example, for the arrows.</v>

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh-huh.</v>

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, maybe.</v>

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, maybe this way.</v>

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And then we'll you will come here.</v>

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.420
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yeah.</v>

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.660
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Right Max as you need to, we, we can talk about streaming together.</v>

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, that's cool.</v>

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.930
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Maybe make some calls or so with pizza.</v>

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Oh.</v>

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.730
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh and my work.</v>

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's cool. OK.</v>

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That's just this year.</v>

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, any problems yesterday?</v>

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.130
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>The unit testing first.</v>

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I didn't understand how to do it then.</v>

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.250
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Didn't know what to test.</v>

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.150
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.810
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, that's something.</v>

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But it took that, but now it's better, yeah.</v>

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.520
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Looks good so far, but I are you getting errors or is everything passing?</v>

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.390
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>It's not.</v>

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.330
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>It now it's possible.</v>

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, cool.</v>

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.550
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that's promising.</v>

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>That's cool.</v>

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, nice.</v>

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>But that's.</v>

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, let me let me show you what I've done yesterday.</v>

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.450
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Ohm.</v>

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Let's see.</v>

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.840
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, I will share my screen again.</v>

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.950
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, so I worked on uh improving this uh bar chart, but at first it looked better.</v>

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But then Allison told me to put the years I think on the X axis.</v>

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And UM, the registered news, I think on the Y axis, but UM, I'm using some bar chart from Streamlet and I don't quite know how it works, and I also don't quite know how to like change it.</v>

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.140
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So I need to look into that a little further.</v>

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So it was kind of looking like this.</v>

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>With any told me to change it a little bit, but so I'm working on that still, uh.</v>

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Did in VSO codes, I changed all the relative paths so at one can open it now on their computer.</v>

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, I I saw that and it's worked for me so.</v>

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yep, that's what they did for every single one.</v>

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>I, uh uh.</v>

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Kept improving some code that didn't work properly.</v>

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.350
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, yeah, that's what I did, I think.</v>

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:56.660
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>And I still have to look into what chart to put on the homepage because now it looks like this.</v>

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>There's just and then at the tutorial or something like that.</v>

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But yeah, but you guys wanted a bar chart on the home page, right?</v>

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.280
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.550
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah.</v>

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.320
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, just.</v>

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So I need to look into what the put there and the map facials.</v>

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I mean, that's just some some visual like.</v>

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Come again?</v>

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.290
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, like some not, not necessarily.</v>

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK.</v>

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like some barter, but generally like some visual to attract, like the attention.</v>

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, I'll try to put it there and the map charts now load a lot faster.</v>

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>On this.</v>

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.130
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So at first it's uh, it needs to run.</v>

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Uh, it it it.</v>

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>It needs to load in every single every single map.</v>

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.640
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So at first it runs quite slow.</v>

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:47.630
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Umm.</v>

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.920
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Nothing.</v>

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>When you go back to 2018, for example, when it ran first, it runs in like 2 seconds.</v>

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:54.900
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Ohh that's.</v>

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>That's nice.</v>

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.860
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Like it will be so much better for the presentation.</v>

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.130
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>No.</v>

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.590
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>True.</v>

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>What's the problem?</v>

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>So that's what I worked on.</v>

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.170
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>What about the correlation matrix?</v>

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Do we have it?</v>

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Uh, it's tremely somewhere.</v>

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>This is still to be done.</v>

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.620
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>The correlate it's not in streamlets that I'm now of.</v>

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, like so, we still have to implement it, right?</v>

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So I think that's.</v>

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.480
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Yet this the the yeah, that one also has to has to go and just stream it.</v>

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But ISA was working on that.</v>

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK.</v>

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Hmm.</v>

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah, it's it's uploaded to GitHub, but I didn't yeah combine it with any other page.</v>

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>No, just I'm saying to not forget about it because I think it's like a valuable thing.</v>

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.560
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>For the our research questions.</v>

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, so that still has to be done.</v>

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>OK, that's if you, yeah, if you get.</v>

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.550
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>We also need to figure out, but do we want more uh charts over here?</v>

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Because I only now have a crime line chart, which works fine, I also did it yesterday.</v>

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.030

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.700
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>What I wanted to do now is just to fill in the learning log together.</v>

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.050
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So that I lose.</v>

<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>Yeah, it's.</v>

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:41.650
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>You know, it isn't it easier like to fill it in together so we don't have to, like, send it to each other?</v>

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Like we're all in a group chat now.</v>

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I what do you mean?</v>

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>No, I think at least in my opinion, it would be faster if we if we if we one focus on something else like I could.</v>

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.380
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah.</v>

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:22.840
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>So the I love 7 for example, I would take some screenshots and yeah you would do some other lol and look for like the proofs and then we could like meet together to read all of them.</v>

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:34.780
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>And yeah, if we for example I did Hilo 7 and we read it all together in you come up with some idea that we we should put some something more than we can together like this but.</v>

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.220
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I agree.</v>

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.310

<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Yeah.</v>

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>OK, so who's gonna do what I'll owe?</v>

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That's a good question.</v>

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Dziechciarz, Michal (225484)>I can do seven, so that is.</v>

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.690
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>I mean, the first two are individual, right?</v>

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:47.850
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>That.</v>

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>Come again?</v>

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>First, I know, I know. It's.</v>

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Rouah, Marwa (223256)>Yeah, that's individual.</v>

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.700
<v Mierde, Isa van der (224299)>Things change.</v>

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Meiners, Max (214936)>But for now, I'm gonna hit uh.</v>
