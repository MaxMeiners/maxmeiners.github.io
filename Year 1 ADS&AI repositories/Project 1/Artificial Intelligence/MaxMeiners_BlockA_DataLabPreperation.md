# DataLab preparation (Week 1, DataLab 2)

### The next DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As part of the learning process, you will be asked to participate in a in-class workshop. In order to participate in this workshop, you will need to have a topic for your presentation:
#### If you have not found, and described a ‘milestone' in the history of AI yet, please do so by the end of the day (Exercise 1.1c, Wednesday, Week 1).

- The first autonomous robots. In 1948 William Grey Walter created Elmer and Elsie. These two robots were the first to work autonomously - independent of a human. They could navigate their way around obstacles using light and touch.

# Datalab 2: Presenting
## 3) Workshop: presenting

#### b. What is an informative speech? And what are the four types described in the book Public Speaking? Write your answer down.
- The primary purpose here is to give the audience information that they did not already know, or to teach them more about a topic with which they are already familiar. Four types of informative speech are definitional speeches, descriptive speeches, explanatory speeches and demonstration speeches.  

#### c. What makes an informative speech interesting, coherent, and memorable? List, and describe at least one technique.
- Speakers can arouse interest by using attention getting elements, telling a story, adding creative features, and stimulating the intellect of the audience. Speakers can create coherence through logical organization, the use of simple language, and by avoiding information overload. Finally, a speaker can make a speech more memorable via repetition, appealing to different ways of learning, and by using visuals appropriately.

#### d. Prepare a 3-minute informative speech where you present your history of AI ‘milestone':

1. Create an outline for your presentation
2. Think about the tool(s) that you would like to use for your presentation (e.g. PowerPoint, whiteboard etc.)
3. Practice your presentation (this includes timing it!)

## 3) Workshop: Feedback
#### b. List, and describe the types of feedback, and models presented in the article How to give and receive feedback effectively by Hardavell et al., (2017). Write your answer down.
1. Informal feedback: This is the most frequent form. It is provided on a day-to-day basis, and is given on any aspect of a doctor’s professional performance and conduct, by any member of the multidisciplinary team. It is usually in verbal form.
2. Formal feedback: This comes as part of a structured assessment; it can be offered by any member of the multidisciplinary team, but most frequently 
3. Formative feedback: is about a learner’s progress at a particular time through a course or during the acquisition of a new skill. It provides opportunities to gain feedback, reflect and redirect effort before completing a final assessment.
4. Summative feedback: measures performance, often against a standard, and comes with a mark/grade and feedback to explain your mark.
