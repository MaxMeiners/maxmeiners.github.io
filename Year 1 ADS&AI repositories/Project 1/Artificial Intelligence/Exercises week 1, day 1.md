- A self-driving car
- Smart assistants
- Robots in manufacturing businesses

### 2.2 Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence
#### b. Define the following terms: ‘weak AI', and ‘strong AI'.
- Strong AI has a complex algorithm that helps it act in different situations, while weak AI are pre-programmed by a human.

#### d. What is the ‘Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.
- It holds that a digital computer executing a program can’t have a mind or consciousness, regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.

#### e. What is the ‘Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:

- a) Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand 
- b) Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs 
- c) It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding 
- d) No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding
- **D, because, according to the Chinese room experiment, it is impossible for a computer to have a mind of it’s own. Or to understand, like us people do.**

#### f. Connect the Post It notes (Fig 2.) to the relevant quadrant in the philosophy matrix (Fig 3.). For example, A = 1, 2, and B = 3, 4, 5 etc. Elaborate on your choices.
