## 1) Introduction to data ethics
#### c. In the video, she makes the following statement: â€˜Algorithms are opinions embedded in code'. What do you think she means with this statement, and what are the possible implications that could arise from it? Explain your answer.

## 2) Applied data ethics
#### a.  In the article How to make a chatbot that isn't racist or sexist Will Douglas Heaven presents three approaches to making chatbots safe for public use. List, and briefly describe these approaches, and explain why it is so difficult to stop a language model from generating offensive texts. Write your answer down.
- 1. Bolt it onto a language model and have the filter remove inappropriate language from the output.
- 2. Use a filter to remove offensive examples from the training data.
- 3. Make chatbots safer by baking in appropriate responses.
- It is difficult to stop a language model from generating offensive texts because a model trained on a data set stripped of offensive language can still repeat back offensive words uttered by a human.

#### b. Find three newspaper articles on a risk and/or benefit associated with a domain and subdomain of AI (e.g., perception, computer vision, planning, natural language processing, searching, etc.), and fill in the table below:
1. Robot dog
  - Boston Dynamics.
  - Robot dog identifying safety and structural issues.
  - Machine learning, robotics and automation
  - Can inspect even de smallest of spaces, while gathering and recording data useful for the study and planning of interventions.

2. Racist Chatbot

  - AI Chatbot you can have a conversation with
  - Communication, NLP
  - This AI technology can get really out of hand.

3. Retina scanners
  - Amsterdam Airport
  - Surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition software
  - Perception, computer vision, learning, and machine learning
  - This AI technology is able to pick out people whom may not travel due to things they have done.
