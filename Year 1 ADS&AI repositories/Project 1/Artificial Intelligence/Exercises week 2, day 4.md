> Taxonomy of AI (2)
## 1) Predictive analytics: To learn or not to learn…
#### b. Define the terms ‘supervised' and ‘unsupervised' learning. How do these types of machine learning differ from each other? Write your answer down.
- Supervised machine learning relies on labelled input and output training data, whereas unsupervised learning processes unlabelled or raw data.

#### d. Define the terms ‘inference', and ‘expert system' (Be concise!).
- The inference engine is part of the expert system.

#### e. Are artificial neural networks (ANNs) similar to the human brain? Support your answer with arguments.
- It looks the same as the human brain, but it is not. The number of neurons in a human brain is about 86 billion, where the neurons in an ANN is less then 1000. This is nowhere close to the number of neurons in the human brain.

#### f. An ANN uses a a) symbolic or b) connectionist approach to AI? Select one of the options, and explain your choice.
- It uses an connectionist approach, because each connection can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives signals and then processes them, when he can then signal other neurons connected to it.

#### g. Can you think of a real-life scenario where an AI method that uses a symbolic approach would be more suited than a method that uses a connectionist approach? Explain your answer.
- In video games, for example, the AI will be better of with a symbolic approach. This is because it can learn quicker by seeing everything as symbols and then using that knowledge to play like a normal player would.
