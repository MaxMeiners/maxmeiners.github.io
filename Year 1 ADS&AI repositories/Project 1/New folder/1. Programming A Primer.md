# Programming: A Primer

### 1. 
#### a. What's an algorithm?
- A science
- A step by step set of instruction for solving a specific problem
- A sequence of steps that repeats indefinitely
- English like syntax that resembles a programming language

#### b. What symbol represents a conditional statement in a flowchart?
- A circle
- A diamond
- A rectangle
- An oval

#### c. Can a connector in a flowchart have arrows on both ends? If no, why not?
- Yes
- No

### 2. In the creative brief for Data Science I, you followed a sequence of steps in order to develop your creative brief, the Dashboard-Our World in Data. Represent the steps you took using a flowchart.

### 3. Develop an algorithm to find the largest of 3 numbers a, b, c. Use a flowchart to help design your algorithm.

### 4. Develop an algorithm to compute the mean and variance of a given variable. Can you apply computational thinking to this problem? (hint: look for repeating patterns)

### 5. Using computational thinking, write down a set of â€˜exact instructions' on how to cook your favourite recipe.
