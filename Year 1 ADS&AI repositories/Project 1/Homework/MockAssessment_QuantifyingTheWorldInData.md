# Quantifying our World into Data
## 2) Preparation for DataLab
#### b. Questions: Defining objects as data

- Choose an object to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
  - My PS5
- Describe the object in at least 100 words.
  - It's a thick computer system and black of color. You can play several games on the device, but you do need a screen to actually play the games. It is also possible to stream videos on the device.
- Quantify the object into (at least 10) variables.
  - Thick
  - Black of color
  - Internet connection
  - Play games
  - Looks like a modem
- Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the object.

#### c. Questions: Defining phenomena as data

- Choose a phenomenon to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
  - Northern lights
- Describe the phenomenon in at least 100 words.
  - The northern lights are shafts or curtains of colored light visible on occasion in the night sky. Northern lights are also known as polar lights. It's a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
- Quantify the phenomenon into (at least 10) variables.
  - Time of date
  - Place
  - Bright colors
- Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the phenomena.

# Problem Statements and Research Questions
## 1) Forming a Problem Statement
#### Exercise 1: Write down the different ways you can get started writing your problem statement.
- Identify the problem
  - Describing the ordinary world: how the world would be without the problem
  - Provide evidence of the problem
  - Link the problem to the other things
- Define key terms; especially variables
- Provide the background

#### Exercise 2: Form a draft of your problem Statement
#### Step 3. Choose your SDG Indicator (e.g. Extreme Poverty) to study.
- End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
- Target 2.1: Universal access to safe and nutritious food
  - SDG Indicator 2.1.1 = Prevalence of undernourishment

#### Step 4. Form your problem statement and write it down in your notes.
- Almost 10% of the world's population is undernourished, this is more than 663 million people. Most of these people are located in the African continent. How can we bring the 10% down to 0%?

## 2) Forming a Research question
#### Step 2. Form your research question and write it down in your dashboard. Note down the type of research question you're asking. Make sure it is concise, specific and simple!
- How can it be that there is much undernourishment in the African continent?
