# Supervised Learning (week 4, day 2)

### 1. Yesterday, you identified if your creative brief requires a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm. If you picked supervised, what type of supervised learning model is required to predict the outcome - viewer ratings? (classification or regression)
- The classification one

### 2. Can you comment on the relationship between the value of k and the accuracy of the model? Hint: check what happens when k is relatively small and when k is relatively large.
- They are very similar to each other.
