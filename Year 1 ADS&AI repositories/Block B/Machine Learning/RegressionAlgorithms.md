# Linear Regressions (week 4, day 4)

### 1. In your own words, try to explain what a linear regression model is and how it works using a simple example.
- A linear regression describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one (or more) independent variables, X.

### 2. Do you think it's advisable to focus on one metric rather than 3? Why or why not?
- I would rather focus on al 3, because then you can see which metric best applies to your Linear Regression model.
