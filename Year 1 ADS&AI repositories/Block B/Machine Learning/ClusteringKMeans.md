### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- In supervised learning, input data is provided to the model along with the output. In unsupervised learning, only input data is provided to the model.

### 2. In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of unsupervised learning?
- A pro could be that it requires less manual data preparation and a con could be that the results may be unpredictable or difficult to understand.

### 3. List 3 examples of unsupervised learning.
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Data exploration

### 4. Looking back at the creative brief, can you think of use-cases where unsupervised learning can be applied? Be creative and think outside the box!
- We could apply unsupervised learning to use-case 2, because this is the use-case where we only input data into a model.
