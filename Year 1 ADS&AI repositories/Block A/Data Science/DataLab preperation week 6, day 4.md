# **Reporting and Visualizing Data**

---

## 3) DataLab preparation
By now you probably noticed that the template you are given doesn't neccesarily make for a good data report in Power BI. It matches all the criteria and learning objectives for Data Science fundamentals which is key and you have to meet those. However, it makes it challenging to create a dashboard which both tells a good story using the data and meet those criteria. So that's today's challenge: try to marry both of those goals!

- Open your dashboard and save it as a Power BI file called "PRE_DataVisualizationDatalabPreparation" to your Github. Now, save the same dashboard as a Power BI file called "DataVisualizationDatalabPreparation" to your Github. Here you should note down any improvement you propose or make as comments. The first one is the old one for comparison. You can also copy and paste bits of the internet to brush up your visualization or to refer to as inspiration by linking those webpages or referring to specific articles/books.
- Look at the data visualizations you made for your dashboard. Do you see anything you'd like to change? Anything that could help you tell a better story using the data? How do you meet the creative brief requirements but still tell a good story using your data? Take a look at ILO 4.1 and 4.2 to estimate how well you're doing and how you can meet those requirements! You can also change the dashboard layout if it helps you to tell a better story.

Done? Upload your 2 files + any additional ones to your GitHub repository.

    - I added filters for all my visualizations to only that visual, instead I could add the filter on the entire page, so I don't have to add them every single time.
    - When my dashboard is done, I will use the publish button in Power BI to publish it.
    - I might add a mobile layout to my dashboard, to make it more visible on a mobile phone.
    - I can sync slicers together using the "Sync slicers" button.
    - Can add conditional formatting to a table in my dashboard.
    - Can add bookmarks to visualizations, that when you clock on one visualization only that visualization will be shown on screen.
