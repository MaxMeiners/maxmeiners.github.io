DataLab preparation 2
- Get a piece of paper to write on or create an .pbix file called "LinearRegressionDatalabPreparation" and save it to your the GitHUb.

- Now we're going to try to develop some analyses we can apply on our SDG Indicator dataset: preferably the data you use for your own project.

- Formulate and justify a linear regression analysis in less than 150 words. So, we're only asking you for a written proposal, not executing the analysis but feel free to challenge yourself! Doing the actual analysis is part of the Gold Medal for this block after all!

  - When I add a linear aggression to my dashboard, I will be able to see how the undernourishment in Africa will get lower or higher in the future, according to all the data I have collected. I tried to put a linear aggression in my dashboard, but couldn't get it to work.
