## 1) What is data, information & knowledge?
#### c. Provide two additional examples, where you specify the four DIKW stages:
1. 
- Example: Rain
- Data: It is raining.
- Information: The sky turned dark and grey and clouds began to form.
- Knowledge: Some droplets fall through the cloud and form into raindrops on their way down. As more and more droplets join together they become too heavy and fall from the cloud as rain.
- Wisdom: Based on previous observations and statistical models, we are able to predict the weather in the future. We have weather apps on our phone that tell us when it's about to rain.

2. 
- Example: Hail
- Data: It is hailing.
- Information: Clouds are beginning to form and it's freezing outside.
- Knowledge: A thunderstorm updraft lifts a water droplet above the freezing level in the atmosphere. The frozen water droplet then accretes super-cooled water, which freezes once it comes in contact with the frozen droplet. This process causes a hailstone to grow.
- Wisdom: Based on previous observations and statistical models, we are able to predict the weather in the future. Weather apps can give us information about when it is about to hail.

## 2) Data analysis methods
#### e. Come up with at least one situation, where you could deploy a descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. Elaborate on your answer.
- A store that is going to renovate:
  The owner doesn't completely want to renovate but wants to keep selling the best products. By using these types of analysis the owner can look at what the best and worst selling products are.

#### f. Power BI is one of the most popular dashboarding tools. List another dashboarding tool, and provide at least one ‘strength' and ‘weakness'. Write your answer down.
- Databox is another dashboarding tool.
- Strenght = It has customizable tools and has various data visualization options.
- Weakness = It takes a long time to set up and it lacks customizable dates.
