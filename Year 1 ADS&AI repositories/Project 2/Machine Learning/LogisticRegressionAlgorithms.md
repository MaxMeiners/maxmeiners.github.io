# Logistic Regression Algorithms

### 1. What are the differences between classification and regression? Think in terms of the type of target variable and the type of output that the model produces. As you learn more about classification today, try to add more points that help you clearly distinguish between classification and regression.
- Classification is about predicting a label and regression is about predicting a quantity.

### 2. What is the accuracy of this classifier?
- Not very high, it got most of it wrong.

### 3. Is this a good classifier? Why or why not?
- It is not, because it got a lot of pictures wrong.

### 4. Using this ML model, your doctor informs you that you do not have a tumour, what would you do? Would you trust the doctor? Why or why not?
- I would not, because the model already made a lot of errors when looking for whether there is a cat on the picture or not.

### 5. What additional information can the doctor provide regarding the model that will help you gain trust in it's decision?
- The doctor can ask other doctors to take a loot at the picture and if all of them agree whether it's a tumor or not, then I would gain trust in it's decision.

### 6. Using our x-ray classifier confusion matrix, what is the precision of this classifier?
- 

### 7. Using our x-ray classifier confusion matrix, what is the recall of this classifier?
- 

### 8. Now that you know that accuracy alone doesn't help, what additional information can the doctor provide regarding the model that will help you gain trust in it's decision?
-
