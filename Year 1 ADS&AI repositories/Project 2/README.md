> The client has approached you – the Data Scientist – with the aim to analyse their current TV viewership metrics and present a plan to improve their data usage (with multiple sources) and ultimately, increase their TV ratings.

**Specifically, the goal for this block is to develop a model that predicts viewer rating (using Twitter and content data, and any additional data you can collect) using Machine Learning Algorithms and write a report on it. Additionally, the report should contain a section on AI ethics using the knowledge acquired during this block.**
